 * Method Name: main <br>
 * Method Purpose:
 * You are to write a driver program that will interact with the CustomerOrder
 * class to process a customerâ€™s order.  Your program is to interact with the
 * user by getting all customer input related to the order.  It should then use
 * the CustomerOrder class to store the information and get information back
 * related to the order for display to the user.  Ultimately, you will be asking
 * for the order information and displaying their order results to the screen in
 *  the form of a bill statement as shown in the screen shot below.  While your
 * output does not need to look exactly like what is shown, it should have the
 * same information and should be displayed in a neat, readable format with all
 * currency formatted to 2 decimal places.
 * <br>

 * Date created: 11/2/2015 <br>
 * Date last modified: 11/3/2015 <br>
 *
 * <hr>
 * Notes on specifications, special algorithms, and assumptions:
 * Once you have all of the required order information, you should store that
 * information in an object of the CustomerOrder class using the appropriate
 * methods.  At that point, you can begin to process the order and display the
 * final bill to the user.  You may not do any calculations in your driver
 * program.  All of the functionality is provided in the CustomerOrder class.
 * You are to call the appropriate methods to get the information that you need
 * in order to display the bill to the customer. Once the program has displayed
 * the bill to the customer, it should ask the user if they would like to place
 * another order.  If they answer yes, your program should repeat from the
 * beginning.  This should continue until the user indicates that they have no
 * more orders to place.
